        <h1>Simple Documents</h1>
        <p>
            As a newcomer to Rust, it surprises me that the Rust test framework is woefully deficient. One of the most important
            issues when learning a new language for me is how good the test framework is. Now I know there are other 3rd party test
            frameworks like stainless, but this requires the nightly build of Rust. As a Rust beginner, this is not a practical
            route to go down, I need a stable platform to work on, without having to trouble shoot issues (which I don't currently
            have the skills to cope with) that may occur as a result.
            
            A test framework, without fixtures is next to no use at all. And Ideally, a mocking framework also needs to be included;
            genuine TDD is not practical without these features, and I feel a bit frustrated in having to refer to 3rd party
            solutions, when learning Rust is difficult enough as it is.
            
            Is there a plan to get these features into the stable release of Rust?
